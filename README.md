##### I use bash shell as the sample language for this packaging

The process of creating an RPM package is as follows
- Check rpmdevtools package is installed, which provides utilities for packaging RPMs.
- Create a shell program.
- Add execute permission
- Create a LICENSE.
- Create the archive for distribution.
- Use rpmdev-setuptree command to create rpmbuild directory.
- Create an RPM SPECS archive and place it in rpmbuild/SPECS.
- Put the previously packaged tar file into rpmbuild/SOURCES.
- Use rpmbuild command to build a binary RPM.
